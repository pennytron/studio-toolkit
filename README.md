# Studio Toolkit ‚Äì After Effects CEP Panel
### No more File>Scripts, no more hunting through your Downloads folder, or that mess of docked tabs!

- A simple, lightweight CEP panel that makes running After Effects scripts fast and hassle-free.  
- Provides a simple UI to run ExtendScript (.jsx) files quickly. 
- Saves time by eliminating the need for multiple script panels; run the script, close the panel, have easy access again later.  
- Open-source & fully customizable if you want to tweak the look & feel.

### A Note from a Creative, Not a Coder

I‚Äôm just a creative who needed a better way to run scripts in After Effects ‚Äî so I made this.  
This isn‚Äôt a perfectly optimized, code-guru-certified, airtight script. It‚Äôs a tool I built for myself that I figured might help others too.  

You might find some gaps in my knowledge, some _‚Äúcreative‚Äù_ coding techniques, and maybe even a few messy comments. But that‚Äôs the beauty of open-source ‚Äî we build, we learn, we improve together.

If you find something that could be better, go ahead and tweak it! If you have feedback, let me know. I want this to stay useful, accessible, and something that makes our lives easier.

# Quick Start

Place the panel folder studio-toolkit in the following directory:

  **Windows:** `C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Adobe\CEP\extensions`  
  **Mac:** `/Library/Application Support/Adobe/CEP/extensions`

Restart After Effects.

## Accessing the Panel

Open After Effects.

Navigate to Window > Extensions > Studio Toolkit to open the panel.  
Dock the panel somewhere in your layout.  

## descriptions.json
You can customise how script names appear in the panel by adding a `descriptions.json` file to the **root** of the folder you‚Äôve selected in Studio Toolkit as your script source.    
In other words, this will 'prettify' the filenames of your scripts within the panel. Copy & paste the below example into any text editor, and save it as a .json, to get started.

**For example:**  

```json
{
  "example-script-1.jsx": "Example Script 1",
  "project_ScriptName.jsx": "Auto Fade In",
  "autoLabelSelector.jsx": "Label Selector"
}
```

## Excluding folders
Prefix them with a period ` . ` or wrap them in square brackets ` [ ] `.  
How you use this feature is up to you!  

# FAQ
**Can I use this panel in other Adobe apps?**  
This panel is designed for After Effects but could most likely be adapted for other Adobe software.  

**How do I reset the panel to its default settings?**  
CEP panels store cached settings in a folder. Deleting this resets the panel to default settings.  
_Note: this doesn‚Äôt reset anything if you have changed the code files! It just lets you open the panel as if you have just installed it._

**Windows:**  
`C:\Users\[yourusername]\AppData\Local\Temp\cep_cache`  
**Mac:**  
`Users/[yourusername]/Library/Application Support/Adobe/CEP/cep_cache`

_These folders could be hidden; you will need to Show Hidden Files (or your systems equivalent of that action) to be able to see them._  

**Can I add custom buttons or features?**  
Yes! Add HTML elements to index.html and connect them to ExtendScript via script.js and main.jsx.

# Free & Open, For the Community

Hey there! üëã

Studio Toolkit was made with one goal in mind: To help creatives and teams work **smarter**, not _harder_, when using After Effects. This project is 100% free and open-source because I believe in sharing knowledge, helping each other grow, and making tools that benefit everyone.

üîì What This Means for You:  

‚úÖ You can modify it for yourself or your team.  
‚úÖ You can learn from it, tweak it, and make it work best for your workflow.  
‚úÖ You can share those modifications stress-free within your team.  
‚ùå You can‚Äôt take it, change the name, and sell it as your own product. That‚Äôs not in the spirit of open-source.  

_This panel was created with a lot of help from AI; specifically ChatGPT. Use your AI model of choice to expand & learn!_  

üí° The Open-Source Promise

This project is licensed under GPLv3, which means:

If you modify and share this outside your team, those changes must also stay open-source under GPLv3.  
The community thrives when we all contribute back.  
No one should lock away this knowledge behind a paywall.  

I was inspired by the philosophy behind DUIK‚Äîthat tools made for creatives should stay accessible, open, and community-driven.

So, if Studio Toolkit helps you, inspires you, or makes your workflow smoother, pay it forward. Share your knowledge. Help others. Keep the open-source spirit alive. ‚ú®  

Enjoy, and happy scripting!
